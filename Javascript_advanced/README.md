## Pitfalls

This was an incredibly easy project (Doesn't mean I thought it was bad/didn't learn anything). This was one of the languages I enjoy and was looking the most forward to do.

Biggest pitfall was my own thoughts and myself. The tasks were easy I just overcomplicated them and over thought the challenges in the project.
