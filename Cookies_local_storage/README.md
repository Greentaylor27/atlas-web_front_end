## Lessons Learned

That Cookies are a bad thing in fact there are incredibly useful for mundane things like usernames, first and last names, etc. 

Local storage is storage for your machine one of the problems I faced when using local storage was I have extensions on my browser which were being stored in localStorage so I had to work around that.

Session storage is storage for a session basically for a tab/window it does not carry over to a new tab/window
